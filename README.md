I'm a frontend developer originally from Ukraine, now based in the United States. With a passion for creating user-friendly interfaces and a keen eye for design, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm always up-to-date with the latest frontend technologies and love learning new skills to improve my craft. With a cross-cultural background and a unique perspective, I bring a fresh approach to any project.
